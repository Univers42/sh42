# HASH BUILTIN MANUAL TESTS
# ============================================================================
# Test the hash builtin to ensure command path caching works correctly
# Run these commands interactively in the shell or pipe to minishell -c

# View empty hash table
hash
# Should print "hash: hash table empty" or similar

# Hash a common command
hash ls
hash
# Should show ls with its path

# Hash multiple commands
hash cat
hash grep
hash echo
hash pwd
hash
# Should list all cached commands

# Hash a command that might not exist
hash nonexistentcommand12345
# Should print error "hash: nonexistentcommand12345: not found"

# Hash with absolute path
hash /bin/ls
hash
# Should cache /bin/ls

# Reset hash table
hash -r
hash
# Should show empty table again

# Hash commands and verify they work
hash ls
ls /tmp
# Should work normally

# Delete specific hash entry
hash echo
hash
hash -d echo
hash
# echo should be gone from cache

# Delete multiple entries
hash ls cat grep
hash
hash -d ls cat
hash
# Only grep should remain

# Test hash with non-existent command (should fail gracefully)
hash /nonexistent/path/to/command
# Should print error

# Test hash after clearing and re-hashing
hash -r
hash ls
hash grep
hash
hash -r
hash
# Should be empty again

# Practical usage: hash common tools
hash git
hash find
hash xargs
hash python3
hash
# Should show all cached paths

# Delete and verify removal
hash -d git
hash
# git should not be in the list

# Edge case: hash with spaces in output display
hash find
hash
# Should handle find path correctly

# Performance test: hash many commands
hash ls cat grep echo pwd cd ls pwd
hash
# Should handle multiple hashes without issue

# Final state: clear everything
hash -r
hash
# Should be empty
